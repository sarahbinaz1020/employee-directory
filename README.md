# employee-directory


## Description

An employee directory created using React. Assignment was to break up the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events. 

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

Given a table of random users generated from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/), when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category.

  * Filter the users by at least one property.
